## 2. Detailed Functions
- **Save customers’ time and increase your conversion rate by just only one click “add to cart” to checkout**
After customers added products to carts,  the default process will redirect to the shopping cart page. So how can you disable loading the shopping cart page and redirect to checkout page  right after adding items to cart even when they access intentionally to the URL of the shopping cart?
The fastest way is using the event observer method. It means that you take "**controller_action_predispatch_checkout_cart_index**" event to redirect 301 from the cart page to the checkout page. This is the “fired” event before loading "checkout_cart_index" page.
- **Be suitable for customers who buy single product at once and website selling simple product without choosing quantity.**
When an online shopper only orders a single item at once, now they no longer go through other pages (for instance shopping cart page) to checkout as usually.
**Full key features of Magento 2 Reindex from Backend**
- Create Magento redirect to checkout by using Event observer method
- Suitable for selling single product without choosing quantity
- Easy installation
